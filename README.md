For my third project, since I'm a pretty big Pokemon fan (as you may have realized from my Greninja profile picture), I decided to build a Pokedex. In case you are unfamiliar, a Pokedex is a fictional device in the Pokemon video game, anime, and manga that provides information regarding the various species of Pokemon. I made this website using React JS, Bootstrap, React-Bootstrap, and CSS. To check out the project, click [here](https://pokedex-awesomethan.vercel.app).
